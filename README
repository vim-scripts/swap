1. Visual mode

    1.1 \x

    First select some text ([] represents the highlighted area). Then press \x

    [a ==   123] [  a == 123 ] [a==123]
           |              |             |
          V            V           V
     123 ==   a     123 == a    123==a

    Note: Your selection can be loose and include white spaces at both ends.

    1.2 \\x

    By default the plugin acts on comparison operators
    You are however allowed to specify any pivot for the swapping.

    First select some text. Then press \\x
    You will be asked to give a pattern (% used here)

    Just testing  %  a percentage as a pivot
                             |
                            V
    a percentage as a pivot  %  Just testing

    1.3

    You can also use V, v or ^v to select several lines (v used), then press \x

    a == [123
    user !~ unknown
    0]!=#1
         |
        V
    123 == a
    unknown !~ user
    1!=#0

2. Normal mode

    Swap with WORD on the right \x
    ========================

    # indicates the cursor position in the examples below.

          #
    zero one      a_longer_word three
              |
             V
    zero a_longer_word      one three

    Swap with WORD on the left  \X
    ========================

    zero one two       three
    let's have some more fun
      #      |
             V
    zero one two       let's
    three have some more fun

2.1 Repeat

    This plugin integrates with Tim Pope's repeat plugin. It means that you can
    use . to repeat any normal mode (for now) swap mapping you just used!

3. Supported comparison operators

    Comparison operators
        ===    !==     <>    ==#    !=#     >#
        >=#     <#    <=#    =~#    !~#    ==?
        !=?     >?    >=?     <?    <=?    =~?
        !~?     ==     !=     >=     =~     <=
        !~      ~=

    Logical operators
         &&     ||

    Assignment operators
         +=     -=     *=     /=     %=     &=
         |=     ^=    <<=    >>=

    Scope operators
         ::

    Pointer operators
        ->*     ->     .*

    Bitwise operators
         <<     >>

    Misc operators
         >      <       =      +      -      *
         /      %       &      |      ^      .
         ?      :       ,     '=     '<     '>
         !<     !>

3.1 Custom operators

    You can define your own operators by putting a similar line in your vimrc:

    let g:swap_custom_ops = ['first_operator', 'second_operator', ...]

4. Custom mappings

You have the possibility to define your own custom mappings in your .vimrc:

    vmap <leader>x         <plug>SwapSwapOperands
    vmap <leader><leader>x <plug>SwapSwapOperandsPivot
    nmap <leader>x         <plug>SwapSwapWithR_WORD
    nmap <leader>X         <plug>SwapSwapWithL_WORD

Note: You can replace \x, \\x, \X with whatever you like.
